Hello future maintainer!

Here's how to add a new blog entry.

Blog entries are written in the markdown format.
and are located in the 'BlogEntries' folder.

The entry should be named by the date it was made.

Images should go in a dated sub-folder of the 'BlogImages' folder
for example: the January 1st 2000 blog entry would be in:
                    BlogEntries
                        *1-1-2000.md
             and the images would be in:
                    BlogImages
                        Ë¾ 1-1-2000
                            *image.png

In the BlogEntries.json the 'previewImage' should be the filename
of an image in the dated sub-folder, (as depicted above.)
