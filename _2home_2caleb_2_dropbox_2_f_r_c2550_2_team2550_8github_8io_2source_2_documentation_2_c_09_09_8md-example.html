<p>unsigned int num = 5; // creates a variable of type integer called num and sets it to 5</p>
<p>A note about char and string types: As mentioned earlier, you a char variable is a value between 0 and 127 that corresponds to a character on the ASCII character table. You can either feed it a numeric value (such as 65) or an actual character such as 'A'3. To see an ASCII table, go to <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii</a>.</p>
<p>Variables You can create a variable in C++ by specifying the type and name. int num;// this is valid code, you can declare variables in C++ without giving them a value The reason this is possible is that assigning a value to a variable takes a significant amount of time, so it is pointless to assign every variable you create a 0 if you are going to change it before you use it. For instance, if you are using a variable for user input, then you can create it and give it a value later. Another use for this is if you are using it to store the output of something else. Long story short, don't assign an initial value to a variable unless you are going to be doing calculations on it directly. Note: It is customary to name variables using CamelCase (can also be camelCase) A variable name cannot include a space The variable name must start with either a letter of an underscore '_' You can only use letters, numbers, and underscores when naming variables Variables are typically declared as locally as possible for debugging reasons (I will explain this later) NAME YOUR VARIABLES SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE! Example: don't name a variable that holds user input x, call it something like UserInput. Its name should be self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Constants Declaring a constant is almost the same as declaring a variable. Just put a “const” in front of the type. const float PI = 3.14f;//I put the f at the end because sometimes C++ associates //the float and double types, meaning that floats are treated as doubles //when you declare them. The f tells the compiler that the value must have //no more than 5 significant digits //Unlike variables, you have to define constants when you create them. Note: It is customary to name constants using ALL_CAPS, separate words with an underscore All of the naming restrictions for variables also apply to constants Typically constants are declared at the very top of your code, before anything else happens USE A NAME THAT MAKES SINCE! I cannot repeat that enough.</p>
<p>Arithmetic Operations You can do all of the basic math operations with numerical variables. The following operations are built into C++, they are sorted by the PEMDAS4 order of operations.</p>
<p>Order of Operations: 1) Parenthesis: operations inside () always evaluated first 2) Multiplication, division, modulus: done in order from left to right 3) Addition, subtraction: done in order from left to right 4) Comparison operations 5) Logic operations 6) Assignment operator: if you are storing the value to a variable</p>
<p>Note that exponents are not on this list, that is because C++ does not have an operator for raising numbers to a power. However, there is a function called "pow" that fills this role.</p>
<p>The mod[ulus] operator calculates the remainder... If you divide an equation with a decimal value using integer math (14/4 is a good example), you will end up with a whole number answer that is not estimated, it simply ignores any decimal digits. 14/4 = 3.5 Using integer math, this expression evaluates to 3, but there is still a remainder of 2 In order to get the remainder, use the expression 14 % 4, the resulting value will be 2 The mod operator can be useful in many different situations... you can use it to... Detect whether a number is odd or even: x % 2, if the mod is 0, then you know the number is even Look at only the last digit of a number: x % 10 x % 100 gets the last two digits, x % 1000 gets the last 3, etc</p>
<p>When programming, you often want to add a certain value to a variables and store the result back into that same variable. C++ has a few operators to do that. These shorthand expressions can be seen to the left. One thing worth noting is that x++ and ++x evaluate to the same thing, but there is a difference in some cases, as shown in the code below.</p>
<p>int a, b = 1, 1; // creates variables a and b and //initializes them both to 1 int c, d; c = a++; // the result it 1 /* long version: c = a; a++;</p>
<p>d = ++b; // evaluates to 2 /* long version: b++; d = b;</p>
<p>Comparison Operators Comparison operators can compare two different values. Comparisons you can be run on numbers are... “&gt;”: greater than “&lt;”: less than “&gt;=”: greater than or equal “&lt;=”: less than or equal “==”: equal, evaluates to true if values are the same “!=”: not equal</p>
<p>! (the not operator) can also be used as a unary operation to a logical statement. It will always evaluate to the opposite of a logical value (true of false). //Here is ! as a binary operator... 1&lt;2;//evaluates to true 1&gt;2;//false !(1&lt;2);//false !(1&gt;2);//true //...which is different from using it as a binary operator: 1 != 2;//true 1 != 1;//false</p>
<p>NOTE: It is important that you use the == operator to test and = to declare variables... a == b;//evaluates to true, checks if a is equal to b a = b;//sets a to the value of b</p>
<p>Converting Between Types To temporarily change the type of a variable, use the following code. static_cast&lt;type_to_convert_to&gt;(variable_name);</p>
<p>The following code is valid... // Let's say you want to convert a character into an integer so that // you have the exact ASCII value of it... char ch = 'B'; int chInt = static_cast&lt;int&gt;(ch); // The resulting value of chInt is 66 in this case, 66 is the ASCII value of 'B'. // There are many reasons you would want to convert variable types... // This is just a simple example.</p>
<p>Automatic Type Selection There are certain cases where C++ will automatically determine the type of math to use. Note that integer math is much faster than floating point, therefore, you want to use integers as much as possible.</p>
<p>Condition (If...) The result... all operands (numbers) are int is an integer all operands are float is a float the expression has multiple types of operands is a float Your computer will detect that there is a floating point number in your expression, and automatically use floating point math 3.0 / 2 evaluates to 1.5 3 / 2 evaluates to 1 you store a float result into an int variable the number is cut off at the decimal 2.95 becomes 2 5.37 becomes 5 you run an integer-only expression and store it to a float variable is an integer Integer math will be preformed, even if the result has a decimal value</p>
<p>Integer operations and float variables: As shown in the chart above, 3 / 2 evaluates to 1. This applies even if you are storing the value in a float variable. This could cause some issues, as you cannot always be sure that the numbers you are entering into the float have a decimal place. If they may not, then it is best to surround your expression in a static_cast statement. float x = static_cast&lt;float&gt;(3) / 2; // this will evaluate to 1.5 and store it to x x = static_cast&lt;float&gt;(3 / 2); // will evaluate to 1 and then convert the type, //meaning that 1 is stored to x</p>
