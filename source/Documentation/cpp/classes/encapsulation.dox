/** \page cppclassencap Encapsulation
The protection of certain members of a class is called encapsulation.
- Often, you want the user of the class to be able to read the contents of a variable but not change it.
- Some methods may be implementation details, useful for writing the class but not useful for using it.
- In many situations, you need to check a value before writing it to a variable (and notify the user if it is invalid). A setter method allows you to do this.
