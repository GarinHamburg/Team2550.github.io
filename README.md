==================

This is a website for technical documentation of all kinds that will be useful for FIRST robotics teams. I hope to have it expand and become a useful resource for not only our also many other teams.

FIRST Robotics Team 2550 (Skynet) is the Oregon City robotics team. You can  find more information about the team at [2550 ROBOTICS](https://sites.google.com/site/2550robotics/home).
