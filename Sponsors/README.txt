Hello future maintainer!

Here's how to add new sponsors to the bar.

There are two types of sponsors 'name' & 'logo' 

'name' sponsors are typically used for large individual donors,
and sponsors without a logo.

'logo' should be self explanitory.

The 'alt' text is the name of the company.

'url' is a link to the sponors website.

'image' is used for 'logo' sponsors,
and is the name of the image in the 'SponsorLogos' folder.
to improve load times, it is recommended to use '.webp' images.
